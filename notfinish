today we have a competition, 3 of them are very easy, and the last one is a bit difficult
there is a non-dir graph, with at most 1000 dots, we need to build roads between them, k of them are free, and the max value of the road is the fee that you we need to pay
the question is, what it the minimum fee?
it's hard for me, my teamate finally find out that, dp can solve it

and the other one i haven't finish is a netflow pro.

this weekends we have 2 competition, gl and hf!
